      \item Cleaned up parked domain infrastructure and migrated away from an AWS Route53 based solution to CoreDNS to reduce operating costs and complexity.

      \item Cleaning up and restructuring existing Terraform to reduce complexity. Addressing state drift and investigating disparities between Terraform config as well as environments. Building CI pipelines for Terraform.

      \item Reviewing AWS MSK (Kafka) setup and implementing Topic and ACL management using IaC.

      AWS, Databricks, spark, Terraform, GitHub, Apache Kafka, Lucid Chart, Excalidraw,
      Okta, system design, People Management, Project Management
}
{
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Managed the Data Platform team and the Network Infrastructure team, defining
            the teams' roadmaps and liaising with stakeholders in the greater tech team.
            This also involved mentoring more junior engineers expanding their skillsets
            into cloud engineering as well as Engineering Enablement practices.

      \item Sat across the entire tech department as an SME for AWS and other cloud services,
            notably advising our security functions for cloud and information security.
            Filled a partially operational role managing some of Matches'
            suite of cloud products including GCP, Okta, LastPass, and various DNS providers.

      \item Was responsible for all aspects of the Data team's cloud infrastructure and completely
            redesigned the setup of networking, IAM, and S3 to make security a core part of our use
            of these services.

      \item Lead the design of the new Databricks based Datalake, focusing on resiliency, security,
            and compliance. Designed resilient pipelines for event-driven file ingestion (using S3, SQS,
            and Lambda) and event-sourced ingestion (Apache Kafka, Databricks, and Spark).

      \item Recovered a migration project to replace VPC Peering in favour of AWS Transit Gateway,
            after all previous team members on the project resigned. Managed the integration of this
            new inter-VPC network with our corporate SD-WAN network.

      \item Reorganised the Infra team away from being a ticket-based service team to a project lead team,
            to achieve predictable and consistent delivery on project based work.

      \item Designed and managed the creation of a self-service project for the Data Engineers to speed up
            initial project creation, whilst ensuring security of CI/CD and Application setups through
            specific and least-privileged access principles. This reduced the initial setup of Databricks-based
            projects for the data engineers from up-to two weeks to a day.
