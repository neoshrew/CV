\vspace{-1cm}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Joined the newly formed Infra team owning Cloud Infrastructure and SRE functions.
        Worked on all aspects of our cloud infrastructure projects.
        A large portion of my time was dedicated to helping other teams with their on-demand infrastructure needs,
        debugging issues with their applications and helping with design decisions.

  \item Took over as tech lead in Q1 of 2020. Managed team roadmap, a large component
        of which was prioritising incoming requirements from several disparate and disconnected
        sections of the company. Also managed team growth and development, advising on career
        progression and giving periodic feedback on performance. Heavily involved in
        the recruitment process for multiple engineering roles, and worked directly with the talent
        team to hire members of the Infra team.

  \item Worked closely with the Security and Compliance teams to ensure
        the cloud infrastructure and application design/architecture adhered to industry
        best practices and handled client data appropriately. This involved being a key
        advisor and reviewer for designs of new features involving data.

  \item Performed on call duties and worked closely with the heads of engineering and product support
        to refine our incident handling policies.

  \item Instigated and managed our access control procedures for the engineering department
        to fill a shortfall in compliance, and worked with IT to harden our security
        with better SSO integrations, and utilisation of AzureAD's auto-provisioning
        with SCIM wherever possible.

  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item Joined to help build and run cloud infrastructure team, working
        with several engineering teams in the US to bring RV's tech stack to the EU.
        Authored and maintained reusable Terraform configuration to support migrating
        suites of microservices in AWS cloud.

  \item Migrating these systems involved working closely with the Security
        and Compliance departments from both the UK and the US to ensure they
        adhered to local UK and EU legislation (GDPR, PECR, e-privacy, etc).

  \item Created initial infrastructure for Bankrate UK's initial launch, and worked
        to migrate it from a statically generated site in AWS S3 to an application hosted
        in GCP's Kubernetes engine GKE.

  \item Moved to work with the Data Services team of our new operating partner
        (ZPG Comparsion - uSwitch \& money.co.uk) following a structural change

  \item Responsible for backend application and cloud infrastructure development
        alongside the CTO, taking over migration to a containerised setup using AWS' Container Service (ECS), as well as ongoing maintenance and improvement.

  \item Created new read-only content API to decrease front-end load times and
        reduce server load, by moving away from SQLAlchemy's ORM and writing
        optimised queries for specific search criteria. Also created and fixed
        caching site-wide using Redis to solve periodic site outages related to
        releases and cache space changes.

  \item Worked with the Product and Front-End teams to design extensible data models
        for modelling editorial content, and basic design of back-office CMS
        interfaces.

  \item Instigated new Git workflows and release processes to scale with growing
        numbers of engineers. Worked on extending our in-house build and deploy
