\section{Employment History}

\jobheader
{May 2018 -}{Present}
{Red Ventures}
{Senior Engineer}
\vspace{-1cm}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Joined to help build and run cloud infrastructure team, working
        with several teams in the US to bring RV's tech stack to the EU. Authored
        and maintained reusable Terraform configuration to support migrating of
        suites of microservices in AWS cloud.

  \item Worked closely with the Security and Compliance departments both here and
        in the US as well as engineering teams to ensure that the applications and
        systems being brought over adhered to local UK and EU legislation
        (GDPR, PECR, e-privacy, etc).

  \item Created initial infrastructure for Bankrate UK's initial Launch, and worked
        to migrate it from a statically generated site in AWS S3 to an application hosted
        in GCP's Kubernetes engine GKE.

  \item After a structural change in the business I moved to work with the Data
        Services team of our new operating partner
        (ZPG Comparsion - uSwitch \& money.co.uk)
        to create a new secure real-time eventing pipeline using Apache Kafka
        and AWS' DynamoDB, written in golang.

  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Main Technologies used:}
  Terraform, AWS, GCP, golang, Kubernetes, Apache Kafka

\jobheader
{May 2016 -}{May 2018}
{CondÃ© Nast Britain}
{Software Engineer}
\vspace{-1cm}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item I was responsible for backend application and cloud infrastructure development
        alongside the CTO. I took over migration to a containerised setup using AWS' Container Service (ECS), as well as ongoing maintenance and improvement.

  \item Created new read-only content API to decrease front-end load times and
        reduce server load, by moving away from SQLAlchemy's ORM and writing
        optimised queries for complicated search criteria. Also created and fixed
        caching site-wide using Redis to solve periodic site outages related to
        releases and cache space changes.

  \item Worked with the Product and front end teams to design extensible data models
        for modelling editorial content, and basic design of back-office CMS
        interfaces.

  \item Instigated new Git workflows and release processes to scale with growing
        numbers of engineers. Worked on extending our in-house build and deploy
        tool \textit{Brickyard} in support of these processes.

  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Main Technologies used:}
  Python (Flask),
  Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker, AWS,
