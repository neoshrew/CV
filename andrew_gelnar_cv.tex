      \item Joined the Data Platform team and lead the initial design of the new Databricks based
            Datalake, focusing on resiliency and security \& compliance. Responsible for all aspects
            of the Data team's cloud infrastructure with extensive setups around Networking, IAM

      \item Later moved into core engineering and took on management of the Network
            Infrastructure team who are responsible for Matches' physical network and on-prem
            infrastructure, as well as our AWS-based Windows estate. Managing both teams' separate
            roadmaps and interacting with separate sets of stakeholders across the tech dept.
            Notably this involved recovering a large migration project for our AWS cloud from VPC-peer
            based to Transit Gateway based after all previous team members on the project resigned.

      \item As Principal Platform Engineer sat across the entire tech department acting as an
            SME for AWS and other cloud services, notably advising our security functions for cloud
            and information security. Filled a partially operational role managing some of Matches'
            suite of cloud products including GCP, Okta, LastPass, and various DNS providers.
